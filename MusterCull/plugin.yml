commands:
  mcull:
    description: Pauses, continues, or otherwise controls the plugin.
    aliases: [mustercull]
    permission: mustercull.*
    usage: |
      /mcull pause //pauses all culling types
      /mcull continue //continues all culling types
      You can specify a culling type to pause only specific areas of the plugin:
      /mcull pause spawner //pauses spawner culling
      /mcull pause hard_cap_laborer //pauses the culling of mobs over the global mob cap
      Use /mculltypes to see which culling types can be paused.
      /mcull reset //clears the damage list (not very safe!)
      /mcull damage //sets the damage for the tick laborer
      /mcull count //sets the number of mobs to damage during the tick laborer run
      /mcull chance //sets the chance a mob will be damaged during tick laborer run
