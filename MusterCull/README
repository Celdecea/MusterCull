WARNING:

    ** THIS PLUGIN CAN EMPTY EVERY PERSISTENT FARM ON YOUR SERVER
    ** THIS PLUGIN CAN DISABLE GRINDERS AND SPAWNERS

However, it won't do this without your configuration. Take your time and don't  
cull what you don't need to. Carefully read these instructions; never point a
gun you don't intend to shoot.

DESCRIPTION:

This mod allows mobs to be culled using one of three methods (described
below). Each mob and type is considered individually based on the combination
of a hard limit and a bounding box range. Mobs which exceed the limit can
be prevented from spawning or can be damaged.

CONFIGURING:

Put the jar in plugins and create MusterCull/config.yml

Add the following (you don't need START and END lines):
#-- START -------------------------------------
damage: 2
damage_chance: 70
ticks_per_damage: 20
damage_count: 1
#limits:
#- type: CREEPER
#  culling: SPAWN
#  limit: 100
#  range: 20
#-- END ---------------------------------------

The "limits:" block has four lines underneath. Copy these four lines for each
mob type you want to cull. If you do this, remove the hash sign (#) from the
beginning of each line, including the "limits:" line. Each block needs all
four lines, and the first line must start with a dash and space while the 
remaining three lines begin with two spaces.

If you want to cull a specific mob using multiple culling types (like SPAWN
and SPAWNER), copy the block for that mob and change the "culling:" field. You
can have one block per mob per cull type and duplicate handling is undefined.

With no limits, the plugin will just sit and wait for commands. A console
message will indicate that there appears to be nothing to do.

Field descriptions:

damage_chance:  The percent chance a crowded mob (over limit) will take any
                damage. Values of 70%-90% are normal.
                
damage:   The amount of damage to issue to a mob. Baby animals take double
          damage.

ticks_between_damage:  The amount of ticks to delay between calls to the mob
                       damage laborer.

damage_count:  The number of entities to damage each time the damage laborer
               is ran.

mob_limit: The number of entities before the damage laborer cares to run.

mob_limit_percent: Percent of total entities a mob must be to be queued for
                   damage.

Limit fields:

type:     The name of the entity to manage culling for. These are taken from
          Bukkit's EntityType enumeration and are case sensitive (so use
          upper-case):
		
            CREEPER       SKELETON        SPIDER
            ZOMBIE        SLIME           GHAST
            PIGZOMBIE     ENDERMAN        CAVESPIDER
            SILVERFISH    BLAZE           LAVASLIME
            ENDERDRAGON   PIG             SHEEP
            COW           CHICKEN         SQUID
            WOLF          MUSHROOMCOW     SNOWMAN
            OZELOT        VILLAGERGOLEM   VILLAGER

culling:  The method to use for culling the mob.

            SPAWN    Prevents mobs from spawning using an event listener.
                     If a mob tries to spawn over the limit it is blocked.
                     
            SPAWNER  Variation of SPAWN for just mob spawning blocks, which
                     are not considered under the SPAWN type. To cull all
                     spawning, use both.

            DAMAGE   A timed event damages mobs on an interval if they are in
                     an area with too many of the same type. This can take
                     time and have profound effects on the mob composition of
                     a server, so use with care.
                     
limit:    The hard number of mobs of this type to limit in a certain area. If
          this is zero or less, all mobs are culled.

range:    The distance from the mob to check. If this value is zero or less,
          no checking is performed and cycles are wasted, so comment out
          unused limits from this file.
          
          This is a bounding box range, so 5 would be 10x10x10 cube around a
          player.

COMMANDS:

Help for these commands is available using bukkit's chat help system.

At this time, all commands require server op status to use. A better system
is planned for the future.

          /mustercull - Control the plugin including pause and reset.
          /mustercullstatus - Stats including most crowded players.
          /mculltypes - List types of culling that can be performed.
          /mcullentities - List entities which can be culled.
          /mculllimit - Make session changes to the culling table.
          /muster - Damage mob types around self or specific player.
          /cull - Kill mob types around self or specific player.
          
SUGGESTIONS:

Start with hostile mobs so you don't lose your farms, and set the limit to
something high (like 50 or even 100) and set the range to something low, like
10 or 5. You can then drop the limit or increase the range to values over time
to those which balance well with your server.

Test on creepers! They don't come out of spawners and nobody cares if you kill
them off.

Keep ticks_between_damage a minimum and multiple of the server average tick
rate (like 20). Keep damage_count low (1 or 2 and no more than 5).
